Hello! I am Muhammad Waseem, a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/mechanical-and-aerospace-engineering) at the [University of Virginia (UVA)](https://www.virginia.edu/). I am currently being advised by Prof. [Qing (Cindy) Chang](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/qing-cindy-chang/). My primary research focus lies in the broad spectrum of Production Systems Modelling and Control. 



# Research interests:
My current research interests include *Smart manufacturing*, *Deep Reinforcement Learning*, *Engineering Optimization*, and *Dynamic control*.

I am currently exploring DRL based approaches to efficiently control the complex scheduling of mobile robots in a stochastic Multiproduct Flexible Manufacturing System.
